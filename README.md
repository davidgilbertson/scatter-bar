# Scatter Bar
A chart type for visualising many measurements of the same metric.
For example, load times of a web page.

This repo also has some neat requirements coverage stuff.
See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for a list of tests and 
[REQUIREMENTS_INFO.md](REQUIREMENTS_INFO.md) for a bit more info.
