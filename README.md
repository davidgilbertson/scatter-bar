# Scatter Bar
A chart type for visualising many measurements of the same metric.
For example, load times of a web page.

I thought I invented this but actually it also goes by the names 'strip plot' or 'barcode chart'.

## How does it look?
Check out the [demo](https://scatter-bar.firebaseapp.com) or [this article](https://medium.com/ansarada-thinking/styled-components-v4-the-good-the-bad-and-something-completely-different-e891139e0138) which uses scatter-bar charts.

# Also: this repo is also a guinea pig
I have two little experiments going that have nothing to do with 'scatter bars', and    
I'm using this repo to test them in a real-world app.

## Requirements coverage
See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for a list of tests and 
[REQUIREMENTS_INFO.md](REQUIREMENTS_INFO.md) for a bit more info.

## Recollect
I'm using `react-recollect` in this repo, a state management library I made. In short, it's a Redux replacement.
In long, here's [the readme](https://github.com/davidgilbertson/react-recollect) and 
here's [the blog post](https://hackernoon.com/a-different-way-to-manage-state-in-react-2d21dfb94482).
